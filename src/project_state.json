  "summary": "FIT AMIGO - A comprehensive fitness platform. Phase 1 includes user authentication, navigation structure, e-commerce store for sports products and supplements (product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, order management), and workout tracker (log exercise sessions with sets, reps, weights). Phase 2 includes hybrid product catalog showing both internal products and external products from Go Store API, and admin interface for product management. Phase 3 is split into sub-phases: Sub-phase 3.1 (FiTube video platform + Running Monitor) - completed, Sub-phase 3.2 (Food Tracker with AI-powered food recognition and Nutritionix API integration) - completed, Sub-phase 3.3 (Sports/Fitness News Section with external and internal articles + Web Search across all content) - completed. Now updating Store to work independently with mock sports product data (gym equipment, running gear, sports apparel, supplements) and a search bar for filtering products, and updating FiTube to work independently with mock fitness video data - both sections no longer require external API configuration.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Phase 1 focus: Authentication, navigation, e-commerce, and workout tracker",
    "E-commerce modeled after Amazon/Flipkart with full cart and order management",
    "FiTube will support both embedded external videos and direct user uploads with social features",
    "Food tracker will integrate with external nutrition API (USDA FoodData Central)",
    "Design uses vibrant, energetic fitness colors (avoiding blue/purple as primary)",
    "Phased development approach to manage complexity",
    "Phase 2 adds hybrid product catalog showing both internal and external (Go Store API) products",
    "Admin interface for internal product management separate from external API products",
    "Go Store API credentials and endpoint URL required in environment configuration",
    "Phase 3 split into sub-phases: 3.1 (FiTube + Running Monitor), 3.2 (Food Tracker with AI food recognition), 3.3 (News Section + Web Search)"
